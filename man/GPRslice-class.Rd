\description{
An S4 class to represent time/depth slices of
ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data.
Array of dimension \eqn{1 \times m \times p}
(\eqn{m} traces or A-scans along \eqn{x},
and \eqn{p} traces or A-scans along \eqn{y}), with grid cell sizes
\eqn{dx}, \eqn{dy}.
We assume that the unit along y is the same as the unit along x.
