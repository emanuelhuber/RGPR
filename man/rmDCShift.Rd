\usage{
rmDCShift(x, u = NULL, FUN = mean, ..., track = TRUE)

\S4method{rmDCShift}{GPR}(x, u = NULL, FUN = mean, ..., track = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(\code{GPR}) An object of the class \code{GPR}.}

\item{u}{(\code{integer[1]}) Index of the trace samples used to evaluate for
every trace the DC-shift. If \code{u = NULL}, the function takes
for each trace 90\\% of the samples before time-zero (the number
of samples can vary from trace to trace).}

\item{FUN}{(\verb{function()}) A function to apply on the \code{u} trace
samples (default is \code{mean}; alternatively, \code{median}
could be of interest because it is more robust but slower to
compute).}

\item{...}{(\code{ANY}) Further arguments to be passed to \code{FUN}.}

\item{track}{(\code{logical[1]}) Should the processing step be tracked?}
}
\value{
(\code{GPR}) An object of the class \code{GPR}.
}
\description{
The direct-current offset (DC-shift) is estimated and removed from every
trace individually.
For a given trace, the DC-shift is estimated by a user supplied function
applied on few trace samples, normally the samples before time-zero
(e.g., the average of the samples before time-zero).  Then, the
DC-shift is substracted from the trace.
}
\details{
The direct-current offset (or DC-shift) is a constant bias over time
that slightly shifts the signal amplitude. The DC-shift is best
observed on the trace samples recorded before the signal was emitted.

Modified slots
\itemize{
\item \code{data}: DC-shift removed (data dimensions unchanged).
\item \code{proc}: updated with function name and arguments.
