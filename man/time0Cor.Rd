\title{Time zero correction}
\usage{
\S4method{time0Cor}{GPR}(x, t0 = NULL, method = c("spline", "linear",
  "nearest", "pchip", "cubic", "none"), crop = TRUE, keep = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A object of the class GPR}

\item{t0}{A numeric vector with length equal either to \code{NULL}, or one 
or to the number traces.
The traces will be shifted to \code{t0}. 
If \code{t0 = NULL} `time0(x)` will be used instead. 
If \code{t0} is the time-zero, set \code{keep = 0}.}

\item{method}{A length-one character vector defining the interpolation 
method that are from the function 'interp1' 
from the 'signal' package.}

\item{crop}{If TRUE (defaults), remove the rows containing only zero's 
(no data).}

\item{keep}{A length-one numeric vector indicating in time units how much of
the trace has to be kept before time zero.}

\item{c0}{Propagation speed of the GPR wave through air (used only when
\code{keep = NULL}).}
}
\value{
An object of the class GPR.
}
\description{
\code{time0Cor} shift the traces vertically such that they start at
time zero (time zero of the data can be modified with the function)
}
\details{
When \code{keep = NULL} the amount of time kept is equal to
time taken by the air wave to travel from the transmitter to the
receiver.

\seealso{
\code{\link{time0}} to set time zero and \code{\link{firstBreak}} 
         to estimate the first wave break.
         \code{\link{firstBreakToTime0}} to convert the first wave break
         into time zero.
