\usage{
velSpectrum(
  x,
  method = c("semblance", "winsemblance", "minsemblance", "wincoherence",
    "wincoherence2"),
  v = NULL,
  w = NULL
)

\S4method{velSpectrum}{GPR}(
  x,
  method = c("semblance", "winsemblance", "minsemblance", "wincoherence",
    "wincoherence2"),
  v = NULL,
  w = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of the class \code{GPR}}

\item{method}{A length-one character vector}

\item{v}{A numeric vector defining at which velocities the analysis is
performed. If \code{v = NULL}, then 
\code{v = exp(seq(log(0.02), log(0.3), length = 100))}.}

\item{w}{A length-one numeric vector defining the window length for the
methods 'wincoherence' and 'wincoherence2'.}
}
\description{
Transform the space-time domain of the radargram into a velocity-time domain to obtain 
the velocity spectrum (i.e. change in wave velocity with depth or time). This is achieved by applying
Normal Move-Out (NMO) corrections to the radargram for the range of selected velocities 
and computing a coherency measure for each result. In RGPR, the coherency measure can be defined using 
different functions: "semblance", "winsemblance", "wincoherence", "wincoherence2".
}
\details{
either use 'rec' and 'trans' to compute the distance between the antennas
or give the distance between the antennas (asep)
or \code{seq(x@antsep, by = x@dx, length.out = length(x))}

\describe{
  \item{semblance}{also described as the ratio of input to output
        energy (Niedell and Taner, 1971)}
  \item{winsemblance}{windowed semblance}       
  \item{wincoherence}{Windowed coherence measure based on 
        eigen-decomposition that estimates the 
        signal-to-noise ratio for high resolution velocity analysis
        (Sacchi, 2002)}
  \item{wincoherence2}{Windowed coherence measure based on a log-generalized
        likelihood ratio which tests the hypothesis of equality of 
        eigenvalues (Key and Smithson, 1990)}
